# Crossfund
A decentralised crowdfunding app.
*Our submission for Unfold'22 hackathon.*

## Problem Statement?
One problem with the current state of crowdfunding is verifying if the collected funds are actually being used for the purpose mentioned. To solve this, we have introduced a decentralised method for crowdfunding by implementing a crosschain way for users to donate using the Router protocol. <br>

* The representative of the organization sets a few goals like why they need the money, the deadline for the fund-raiser, minimum contribution required to be part of crowdfunding. 

* The crowd (users) instead of donating directly to the manager, allocates the fund to a smart contract created by the orgamization. 

* Now, to pull the funds from the smart contract the voting should happen and if 50% (or any set amount) of the crowd agrees then only the funds can be withdrawn else it won't be.
<br>
If incase the target(money required) is not met by the deadline the crowd can withdraw their money from the smart contract.

~~Currently deployed~~ on Polygon.
